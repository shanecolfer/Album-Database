# Album Database


This album database has been built for an Enterprise Application Assignment. The web app allows users to sign up, log in and view an extensive music database. The users can remove, edit or database entries, and add albums to their personal favourites.

# Publicly Hosted Version

The most recent version of the web application is available for public use at: http://shanecolfer.com

# Install Local Version
If you would like to install a local version of the application first you must download and install node js from the node website:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once installed, clone this git repository using the following command (git required): 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shanecolfer/Album-Database
```

Then go to the Album-Database directory and run the server using the following command:
```sh
node server.js
```

The following output should be seen if the server has initialised correctly: 
```sh
Listening on port 3000
```

Navigate to the following address in your browser where the app should be running locally:
```sh
localhost:3000
```

You can now use the application through your own locally hosted version. This version is still interacting with the publically hosted MongoDB cluster, meaning you still require an active internet connection to use this version.
